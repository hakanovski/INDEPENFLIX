# INDEPENFLIX

## Overview

**INDEPENFLIX** is a budding video streaming platform dedicated to showcasing independent, amateur, and student-made films. Our goal is to provide a space where emerging filmmakers can share their creative works with a global audience. As a first step in developing this platform, we have created the login screen as part of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This document outlines the details of the project, the technologies used, and the next steps in development.

## Features

   - Options for social media login via **Google**, **Apple**, and **Facebook**.
   - Secure password input with masked characters.
   - Basic error handling for forgotten passwords.

### Future Features

- **Main Screen:**
  - After successful login, users will be directed to a main screen where they can browse and stream a selection of 5 curated films.
  
- **Film Library Expansion:**
